Draft security audit PR: cargo-geiger and cargo-audit results

Summary
-------
I ran cargo-geiger (local run) and cargo-audit in CI. cargo-audit reported no known vulnerabilities in the inspected runs. cargo-geiger reports unsafe-usage counts for `getrandom` (two versions present) and missing data for several target crates in the quick extract. The goal of this draft PR is conservative triage: gather artifacts, note immediate concerns, and propose low-risk mitigations.

Key findings (from local geiger extract)
---------------------------------------
- getrandom (0.2.16 & 0.3.3): used unsafe expressions/functions: combined unsafe exprs ~36. This is expected for `getrandom` which interacts with OS RNG primitives and may use unsafe blocks for platform FFI or syscalls. Recommendation: pin to vetted versions and prefer MSRV-compatible updates; add an audit note explaining the unsafe usage is localized and maintained upstream.
- signal-hook-registry, secp256k1, backtrace, bytes, smallvec: geiger quick extract returned "NOT FOUND" for these crates in the local quick output. Full geiger JSON (local `target/geiger/geiger-full.json`) should be attached for full triage. If CI artifacts are missing/empty we now retry geiger and copy top-level `geiger.json` as a fallback.

Conservative remediation suggestions
-----------------------------------
- For getrandom: confirm upstream commit history and changelogs; if a CVE or memory-safety advisory exists, upgrade promptly. Otherwise document the usage and scope of unsafe in a short audit note in the repo (e.g., SECURITY.md or the PR body).
- For crates not present in quick scan: after CI produces the full JSON (with our workflow hardening), parse `target/geiger/geiger-full.json` to list top crates by unsafe usage and prepare targeted remediation notes.
- Add a CI check gate that fails the PR only when new unsafe usage is detected in our own crates (not in third-party crates) or when cargo-audit reports vulnerabilities. For third-party crates, prefer documentation + pinned updates.

Artifacts
---------
- Attached (local): `target/geiger/geiger-full.json`, `target/geiger/extract_manual.txt` (human extract)
- CI artifacts: `geiger-full-artifacts` (when produced by CI), `cargo-audit-report`

Next steps
----------
- Wait for CI run on branch `audit/geiger-top30-draft-pr` to finish; if artifacts are present, parse them and generate a prioritized list of third-party crates with the highest unsafe counts.
- Prepare conservative remediation PR(s): pin versions, add audit notes, or propose replacements for crates with high unsafe usage if safety risk is high.
- Mask/remove local secret files (keystore.json, priv.hex, pwd.txt) from the working tree. Suggest secret rotation if they were ever committed historically.

CSV excerpt (selected crates)
----------------------------
I generated `tmp_logs/geiger_top30_aggregated.csv`. Excerpt of high-unsafe crates found locally:

generic-array 0.14.7: unsafe exprs 1995
memchr 2.7.5: unsafe exprs 1973
sha2 0.10.9: unsafe exprs 1424

Note: the specific requested crates (`getrandom`, `signal-hook-registry`, `secp256k1`, `backtrace`, `bytes`, `smallvec`) were not present in the top rows of the local aggregate output — they may be absent from this local geiger run, or cargo-geiger on CI will produce a fuller view. See `tmp_logs/geiger_top30_aggregated.csv` for the full list.
